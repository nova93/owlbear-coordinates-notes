# Tasks

- use `localStorage` by default to persist notes (maybe indexedDb because fun?)
- use `localStorage` to save the local state (large/small popover etc)
- implement proper-persistence
- implement auth system for the proper-persistence
- add data validation to endpoints
- add error handling so that users know what they did wrong/how to do it right
  - if I can figure out what what they should have done, why not just do it?
- Implement syntax highlighting in the editor mode
- persist not-saved notes to `localStorage`.
- [idea] Note versioning?
- Where should I host this app?
  - - proper db, I'd like to host them together, where's that?
- Setup CI/CD
- Add testing library (vitest + playwright if e2e is needed)
- FE framework rewrite? Vanilla is cool, but tiring, maybe web components, because fun?
- Add DrizzleORM, because :puke:
- Add linting (biome.js)
- [idea] Attach notes to assets
- [idea] Allow players to view notes
