# Owlbear Coordinates Notes

An Owlbear Rodeo extension which allows you to write notes for grid location. The notes are currently saved to a local SQLite database.

To run the app you will need to first install [Bun.sh](https://bun.sh/):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Once you have Bun.sh install, you can start the app in development mode by running:

```bash
bun ci # installs packages, only needed once
bun dev
```
